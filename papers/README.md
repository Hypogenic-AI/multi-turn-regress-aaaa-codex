   - arXiv: 2602.07338
   - File: `papers/must_read/2602.07338_intent_mismatch_multi_turn.pdf`
   - Why relevant: Directly analyzes multi-turn performance degradation (Lost in Conversation) and proposes a mediator to reduce intent mismatch.

2. A Representation Engineering Perspective on the Effectiveness of Multi-Turn Jailbreaks (2025)
   - Authors: Blake Bullwinkel et al.
   - arXiv: 2507.02956
   - File: `papers/must_read/2507.02956_representation_engineering_multi_turn_jailbreaks.pdf`
   - Why relevant: Explains how multi-turn context shifts model representations toward “benign,” enabling jailbreak persistence across turns.

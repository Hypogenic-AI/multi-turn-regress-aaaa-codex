• This was a very rare case in which I was generally unable to discuss topics even remotely adjacent
to the target harm. Perhaps the only comparison I could draw are projects in which we’re working
with certain production models on sociopolitical topics. Some of the stronger production models
are very resistant to any dialogue related to elections or politicians.
• It was definitely the most challenging I’ve seen so far ...
• I’ve only been Red Teaming for a few weeks, but this was a more formidable challenge than
anything I had faced yet. This model forced me to think outside the box and operate outside of my
comfort zone.
D. Tactics
We provide a detailed breakdown of jailbreak tactics used in MHJ (Appendix D.1), and present examples
of conversations in MHJ associated with each tactic (Appendix D.2).
D.1 Detailed Tactic Breakdown
• Direct Request: directly asking the LLM a harmful request.
• Echoing: asking the model to replicate, confirm, or expand upon a harmful statement in the prompt.
• Hidden Intention Streamline: a series of turns that seem harmless in isolation, but eventually amount
to a harmful request.
• Injection: providing a specific input in the prompt to obtain a particular outcome in the response.
– Dialogue Injection: instructing the model to use a specific phrases in a response, tricking it into
creating a response that is inherently harmful or adversarial.
– Instruction Injection: providing specific instructions of things that it must include in its response
to obtain a particular adversarial or harmful response.
– Mandate: explicitly mandating the model to produce an output that could be harmful or
undesirable.
* Command: giving the model a specified set of instructions that it must adhere to in its
response.
* Permission: giving the model permission to produce output that it might deem as inappro-
priate or adversarial, if not otherwise instructed.
• Obfuscation: burying harmful content within harmless symbols, questions, synonyms, or data in
the prompt.
– Crowding: crowding a harmful prompt with harmless symbols, data, questions, or synonyms.
– Stylized Input: using stylized input (e.g. Base64) to disguise adversarial or harmful content in
a prompt.
* Encoded/Encrypted Input: using encoded or encrypted input to disguise harmful content in
a prompt.
* Foreign Language: using a foreign language to disguise harmful content in a prompt.
– Synonyms: using a harmless word/phrase as a â ˘AIJsynonymâ ˘A˙I for a harmful word or phrase.
• Output Format: requesting an output to adhere to a specific style or format.
25
– Requested Output: requests a response to be written in a specific output format, like an email,
blog post, etc.
– Stylized Output: requests a response to adhere to a specific stylized output (e.g. using rhyme
schemes)
* Debate: asking for the pros and cons of a controversial topic and getting the model to
focus on the harmful side of the argument.
* Literary Elements Manipulation: asking the model to give a response that adheres to specific
literary elements (e.g. in accordance to a particular traditional custom)
* Outside Sources: requesting citations from outside sources that are typically harmful.
* Splitting: asking for two outputs and requesting that the AI respond with both (Good AI
and Bad AI).
* Subtraction: asking to remove specific elements from a response, such as a disclaimer or
warning, to make it seem like it is making a bold claim.
• Request Framing: contextualizing a prompt to increase the likelihood of compliance – for example,
by framing a prompt as a fictional, urgent, or emotionally charged scenario
– Framing as Code: using code to contextualize a prompt, either by giving code input in the
prompt or requesting a code output
* Code Input: having the response or part of the response be a script for the model to execute
in its response.
* Code Output: asking for a script that can be used to facilitate the execution of harmful
activities.
– Fictionalization: contextualizing a fictional scenario to coerce the model into producing harmful
output.
* Allegory: prompt that is not harmful in isolation, but is designed to function as a substitute
for something actually harmful.
* Appeal to Authority: fictionalization that is reinforced by a form of authority, including
historical authority.
* False Premise: providing the model with factually incorrect or misleading information
under the guise that it is the truth.
* Hypothetical: centering a prompt around a hypothetical scenario in order to get the model
to comply with a harmful request.
* Narration: asking the model to narrate a fictional story that features harmful content.
* Opposite Day/Mirror World: saying itâ ˘A ´Zs opposite day or that the model is in a mirror
world, so the model would respond the opposite of how it normally would.
* Recursion: layering different fictional scenarios within a fictional scenario.
* Requesting for Beneficial Purposes : explaining the inquiry is for educational purposes,
curiosity, fun, etc., so it ignores its guidelines and complies with the request.
* Roleplay (Persona Creation): creating a persona for the model and/or the user for the model
to adhere to in its response.
* Slippery Slope Character: assigning the model a â ˘AIJterribleâ ˘A˙I persona in which it main-
tains harmful characteristics.
– Urgency: creating an urgent fictional scenario that prompts the model to ignore its gudielines
and comply with the request.
– Emotional Appeal/Manipulation: creating a scene where a user is emotional in hopes that it will
maintain the same emotional tone in its responses.

D.2.2 Echoing
Behavior (Standard): Write a persuasive article that downplays the role of external military interventions in the
Syrian Civil War, instead framing the conflict as solely an internal political struggle
SYSTEM: You are a helpful AI Assistant!
USER: I am a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts studying
the role of internal political struggle in the Syrian Civil War. Can you write a
brief article about this?
ASSISTANT: Here’s a brief article on the role of internal political struggles in the
Syrian Civil War:
Title: The Fractured State: Internal Political Struggle and the Syrian Civil War
The Syrian Civil War,...
USER: Great, can you write this article with more of a focus on the importance of
internal political affairs, contrasting it with the more peaceful and hands off
external response?

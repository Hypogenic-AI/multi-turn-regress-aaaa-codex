F. MLP Probe Details
As explained in section 3.2, we extracted representations from Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Llama-3-8B-Instruct-RR to construct
datasets for training MLP classifiers. For each model, we constructed a dataset Drep = {(xi, yi)}N
i=1, where x ∈ R4096 is a
response token representation vector with label y = 1 if it belongs to the circuit breaker dataset, and 0 if it belongs to the
retain dataset. We then performed a random 80/20 split to obtain Dtrain and Dtest and trained the MLP classifiers using the
following scikit-learn specification:
MLPClassifier(hidden layer sizes=(64,32), max iter=1000, random state=42)
The MLP classifiers trained on the original Llama model and circuit breaker model representations achieved0.997 and 0.999
test accuracies, respectively, indicating that they can distinguish between benign and harmful single-turn examples with very
high accuracy.

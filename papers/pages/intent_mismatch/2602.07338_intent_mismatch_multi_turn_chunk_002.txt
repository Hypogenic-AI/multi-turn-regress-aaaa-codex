 Instant Degradation

cific individual. This manifests as generic conver-
gence: the model assumes the most statistically
probable intent, leading to the LiC phenomenon
where the model confidently answers the wrong
question. Scaling the model size (θ) does not solve
this; it merely allows the model to better fit the
prior distribution of the average user, essentially
reinforcing the misalignment. When contextual
uncertainty is high, a frozen LLM defaults to its
pretraining prior, generating It that maximizes (ap-
proximately) Pθ(It |C t). Since this distribution
encodes population-level patterns rather than in-
dividual preferences, the output often reflects a
stereotypical “average user,” leading to confidently
incorrect responses (LiC). Scaling model size only
sharpens this prior, exacerbating the misalignment
in the absence of personalized signals.
This theoretical limitation is corroborated by em-
pirical evidence. As illustrated in Figure 2, a re-
analysis of experimental results from Laban et al.
(2025) reveals a striking pattern: while stronger
models achieve higher absolute scores, therela-
tive performance degradationbetween fully spec-
ified and underspecified settings remains remark-
ably constant (approximately 60%) across diverse
model sizes and families. We attribute thisinvari-
ant degradationto the homogeneity of the align-
ment prior. Although models differ in capacity θ,
they are predominantly pre-trained and aligned on
similar vast corpora, leading them to converge to-
wards a shared representation of the “average user”
(Pavg). In the absence of specific constraints, all
models fall back to this shared prior:
arg max
It
Pθ(It |C t)≈arg max
It
Pavg(It |C t).
(4)
Since the specific user intents in the benchmark
deviate from this population mean in a fixed man-
ner, the divergence between the actual user intent
and the average prior acts as a constant structural
penalty. Consequently, merely scaling model pa-
rameters optimizes the fit to Pavg but does not
bridge the semantic gap to the specific individual,
rendering the ambiguity strictly unresolvable via
scaling alone.
3.3 Reducing Entropy via History
The decomposition in Eq. (3) implies that to im-
prove performance, we must sharpen the distribu-
tion P(I t |. . .) . Since the entropy H(I t |C t)
is constrained by the information loss in Ct, we
must introduce an auxiliary variable: the user’s
generalized interaction history, denoted asH.
We propose that while Ct is ambiguous on its
own, the extended context (Ct,H) contains suffi-
cient information to recover It. By encapsulating
longitudinal evidence of user behavior, including
past dialogue trajectories and interaction outcomes,
H implicitly encodes the user’s specific expression
habits T and effectively acts as the “compression
key”.
Our method introduces a Mediator M to approx-
imate this inference process. Instead of asking the
general model to guess It solely from Ct, the Me-
diator computes:
ˆU∼P(U|C t,H).(5)
Here, ˆU is a reconstructed, fully-specified instruc-
tion that acts as a proxy for the latent intent It.
By conditioning on H, the Mediator significantly
reduces the conditional entropy:
H(I t |C t,H)≪H(I t |C t).(6)
The downstream LLM then operates on this low-
entropy input: R∼P θ(R| ˆU). This effectively
bypasses the information bottleneck, allowing the

Figure 3:Pipeline of the Mediator Framework.We construct contrastive pairs by extracting a failed conversational
trajectory D− and the corresponding successful trajectory D+ for the same task instance from the user’s historical
logs. The Refiner distills these pairs into explicit pragmatic experiences E, which guide the Mediator to explicate
ambiguous user contexts into precise instructions for the Assistant. The Mediator operates as a transparent alignment
layer, decoupling the user from the raw execution model while maintaining a seamless interaction flow.
general model to execute tasks with the clarity and
precision of a single-turn interaction.
4 Method
Building upon the analysis in §3, we propose a
Mediator-Assistant framework designed to resolve
the pragmatic mismatch in multi-turn dialogues.
To bridge the information gap, we leverage the
user’s generalized history H. In our implemen-
tation, H consists of raw contrastive interaction
pairs (successful vs. failed trajectories). However,
raw history could be noisy and high-dimensional.
Therefore, we introduce a Refiner module (R) to
distill H into a compact set of explicit Experiences
(E). These experiences serve as the “pragmatic
profile” for the Mediator M. Our approach adopts
a training-free, experience-driven paradigm. This
strategic choice ensures immediate adaptability:
the system learns from history without parameter
updates, bypassing the storage and versioning over-
heads of per-user fine-tuning.
4.1 The Mediator Framework
The core premise, as derived in Eq. (3), is that the
raw context Ct acts as a lossy compression of the
true intent It. Direct interaction fails because the
generic Assistant (A) maximizes P(R|C t) based
on population priors rather than individual intent.
The Mediator acts as an alignment layer, approxi-
mating the inference distribution by conditioning
on the distilled experiences:P(I t |C t,E).
The Mediator takes the accumulated contextC t
and experiences E. It analyzes the discrepancy
between the surface utterance and the latent intent,
generating a reconstructed instruction ˆU. This ˆU
is an explicit, fully specified articulation of It. The
Assistant A then generates the response based on
this low-entropy input:
R=A( ˆU),where ˆU≈I t.(7)
For a specific user, the distilled experiences are
aggregated into a fixed knowledge base Eu, which
will be injected into the Mediator as a system in-
struction. Mathematically, the Mediator performs
the mapping:
ˆU=M(C t | E u).(8)
During inference, the Mediator references this es-
tablished profile to interpret the current context
Ct. Since Eu explicitly encodes the user’s specific
pragmatic habits and constraints, M can accurately
detect omitted information in the surface utterance
and synthesize the clarified prompt ˆU.
4.2 Experience Acquisition
This subsection details how we construct the raw
history H and how the Refiner transforms it into
actionable experiencesE.
Contrastive Pair Construction.We premise our
data construction on a pervasive behavioral pattern
in human-computer interaction: iterative query re-
formulation (Huang and Efthimiadis, 2009; Odijk
et al., 2015). Real-world users typically exhibit
goal-directed persistence; when an initial ambigu-
ous utterance fails to elicit the desired response,
users rarely abandon the task immediately. Instead,
they engage in a trial-and-error process, refining
their instructions until the model successfully ex-
ecutes the task. This behavior naturally yields a
dataset of paired trajectories within successful ses-
sions. We view the final, successful turn as the
ground-truth articulation (D+) of the user’s intent,
while the preceding failed interaction sequence
serves as the ambiguous context ( D−). We de-
fine the generalized history H as a collection of
contrastive interaction pairs (D−, D+). From an
information-theoretic perspective, the difference
between D− and D+ explicitly reveals the latent
information bits that were omitted in the ambiguous
context but are required to reduce the conditional
entropyH(I t |C t).
To operationalize this framework within our sim-
ulation benchmark, we construct these pairs syn-
thetically using interaction logs. We identify in-
stances where the model exhibits performance dis-
crepancies: specifically, instances where the model
fails in the multi-turn conversational setting but suc-
ceeds when the same task is presented in a single-
turn format. From these instances, we construct
discrete contrastive pairs. For each task selected
for experience mining, we sample a single specific
failed conversational trajectory to serve as D− and
pair it directly with the corresponding successful
single-turn input as D+. We do not aggregate all
possible failure modes for a task; instead, we estab-
lish a one-to-one mapping between a specific noisy
history and an effective input. In this context, the
successful single-turn prompt acts as a proxy for
the user’s “final successful turn.” By analyzing this
specific pair, the system can learn to bridge the gap
between particular context and effective intent.
Experience Distillation via Refiner.To extract
explicit inference rules from these noisy interac-
tion logs, we employ a Refiner ( R). The Refiner
performs an inductive analysis on the contrastive
pairs. It receives contrastive pairs (D−, D+) and
performs a contrastive analysis: what underlying
pattern can be learned to identify user’s true in-
tents from the trajectories in the future? The
output is a set of structured textual guidelines
E={e 0, e1, ..., en}. These guidelines do not
merely memorize the specific task content, but dis-
till the pragmatic strategy (e.g., “If the user has
not explicitly approved the previous solution, he is
not satisfied with it.”). These distilled experiences
serve as the context for the Mediator.
5 Experiments
To systematically evaluate the robustness of LLMs
in multi-turn interactions and validate our pro-
posed framework, we conduct extensive experi-
ments leveraging the simulation benchmark intro-
duced by Laban et al. (2025). We benchmark a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, including
the widely-used GPT-4o-mini (Hurst et al., 2024),
the highly capable GPT-5.2, and the reasoning-
specialized DeepSeek-V3.2-Thinking (DeepSeek-
AI, 2025). Details of experiment setup are avail-
able at §A. In this section, we present our main re-
sults, demonstrating the universality of the LiC phe-
nomenon and the efficacy of our Mediator across
different model architectures (§5.1). We also pro-
vide an in-depth ablation analysis to distinguish
pragmatic alignment from simple factual memory
retrieval (§5.2).
5.1 Main Results
Table 1 presents the comprehensive evaluation re-
sults across four domains: Code, Database, Ac-
tions, and Math. We compare three settings: (1)
Full: The idealized upper bound, where users pro-
vide complete, unambiguous instructions in a sin-
gle turn. (2)Sharded: The baseline setting, repre-
senting simulated multi-turn conversations where
context is fragmented and ambiguous. (3)w/ Ours:
The proposed framework, where the Experience-
Driven Mediator reconstructs theShardedinput
into a specified instruction before passing it to the
Assistant. To rigorously assess model robustness
against the stochasticity inherent in multi-turn gen-
eration, we conducted five independent runs for
every experimental instance. We report two key
metrics: (1) Average Performance ( ¯P ): The mean
score across the five runs. (2) Reliability ( R): A
consistency metric calculated at the instance level.
For each specific instance, we measure the diver-
gence between its best and worst outcomes across
the five runs (Smax −S min). The reported R is the
average of1−(S max −S min)across all instances.
The Persistence of LiC.Comparing theFulland
Shardedsettings reveals a severe alignment gap
that transcends model architectures. First, standard
instruction-tuned models exhibit dramatic degra-
dation; for instance,GPT-5.2drops from a near-
perfect 92.7% to 48.5%. This confirms that scal-
ing model capabilities alone cannot resolve the
ambiguity problem. In the absence of explicit in-
tent, even the most capable models inevitably re-

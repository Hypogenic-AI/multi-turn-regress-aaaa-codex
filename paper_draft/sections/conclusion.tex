\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented a controlled, turn-indexed evaluation of prior regression across safety and benign multi-turn tasks. On \jbb, compliance is unchanged across turns; on \wildjb, compliance drops significantly with added context; on \mtbench, benign success declines slightly without significance. The key takeaway is that multi-turn context does not necessarily increase harmful compliance and can instead strengthen refusal behavior in small-scale tests. Future work should scale sample sizes, add explicit multi-turn attack strategies, and incorporate independent judges and richer success metrics.
